# NLP_SpamDetection
# The Spam Message Detection system processes and analyzes a dataset of SMS messages to distinguish spam messages from regular ones. This involves several key phases:

## Data Preprocessing: Leveraging the Natural Language Toolkit (nltk) and pandas, the project cleans the dataset by removing punctuation and stop words, preparing the text for further analysis.

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): The EDA phase explores message length distribution and the differences in content between spam and non-spam messages, providing insights into dataset characteristics.

## Feature Engineering: The system converts the cleaned text messages into numerical features using the Bag of Words model and Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF) technique, allowing the machine learning model to process the text data.

## Model Training and Prediction: Applying the Naive Bayes algorithm, the project classifies messages into spam or non-spam categories. The model is trained on a subset of the data and evaluated on unseen messages to assess its predictive accuracy.

## Evaluation: The model's performance is evaluated using a classification report, which includes metrics such as precision, recall, and F1-score, offering a detailed assessment of its effectiveness.

## Pipeline Implementation: A pipeline is constructed to streamline the process from raw message input to classification output, integrating preprocessing, vectorization, and classification steps into a coherent workflow.
